# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was build as a assigment for BKBN

This is a simple todo list built in react, you can add and check and delete the tasks. 

I learned a lot about states, passing data and functions. 

To build this project, you have to clone it and start it in the local host. You can use npm start.

Thank you!!!
